/**
 * Who owns :port, for the one case the election cannot resolve on its own.
 *
 * Every other way a leader can fail ends with the port being released, so a follower's next tick
 * takes over and nothing has to be diagnosed. The exception is a leader that is **still alive,
 * still holding the port, and no longer answering** — a suspended process (Ctrl-Z on a
 * hand-launched server, `kill -STOP`, a debugger that stopped it), or one wedged some other way.
 * There the election's two halves deadlock by construction: "the leader is dead" is decided by a
 * failed `/ping`, but taking over needs the port actually released, and neither ever happens.
 * Measured before this existed: the follower retried in silence until the tool budget expired (88s
 * for a default-budget tool, ~6.5min for a heavy one), a newly opened plugin could not connect to
 * anyone, and only killing the process by hand recovered.
 *
 * A follower can see the deadlock (its `/ping` fails _and_ its takeover gets EADDRINUSE) but has no
 * way to learn _who_ is holding the port — the OS exposes no such lookup to Node. So the leader
 * leaves a note when it binds. The note is only ever read on that dead-end path.
 *
 * **The note is not trusted on its face.** Naming the wrong pid would be worse than naming none:
 * the whole point is to tell the user which process to kill, and a stale note plus a recycled pid
 * would point at an innocent — plausibly at a _healthy_ Figwright server. So the reader re-derives
 * identity from the OS: the pid must still exist, and its start time must match the one the note
 * recorded (`ps -o lstart=`, whole-second resolution, hence the tolerance). Pid reuse cannot
 * survive that check, because it would have to reproduce the same start second too. Anything that
 * fails to line up degrades to the anonymous message, never a guess.

   * leader long after it launched: a laptop that slept in between, or an NTP step, moves the wall

   * agrees with. Measured sub-second on macOS and Linux for a freshly-started leader either way —
