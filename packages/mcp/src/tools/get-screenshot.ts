/**
 * How many bytes of inlined payload one result may carry.
 *
 * An MCP client reads each stdio message into a bounded buffer — 10 MB by default since SDK 1.30.0,
 * on both the v1 and v2 lines. Exceeding it is not a failed call: the client's transport throws,
 * closes the connection, and every later call answers "Not connected" until the user reconnects the
 * server by hand. It cannot resynchronize instead, because stdio framing is newline-delimited and
 * the discarded remainder of an oversized message has no findable boundary.
 *
 * This is the only Figwright tool that can get near it. Text results are held far below by the
 * client's own output cap (Claude Code: ~25k tokens ≈ 100k chars), but image blocks are not counted
 * as text, so they are the one payload that reaches the transport unmetered — measured at ~2.4 MB
 * for a single 1440×3140 frame, so four frames pass Claude Desktop's 1 MB content limit and ten
 * pass the transport's 10 MB.
 *
 * The budget is derived from that limit rather than picked, and deliberately sits just under it
 * rather than comfortably under it. A budget lower than it needs to be would withhold exports the
 * transport could have carried perfectly well — turning a working single-node call into a deferred
 * one, which is a regression, not a safeguard. The margin only has to cover what rides alongside
 * the payloads (labels, the closing note, the JSON-RPC envelope), and that measures under 1 KB;
 * half a megabyte is three orders of magnitude more than it needs.
 *
 * This is the batch-level twin of a cap the sandbox already applies per image: `capScaleForVision`
 * bounds one raster's pixels partly because a single image has its own provider ceiling (10 MB
 * encoded image data on some providers). That cap bounds bytes only indirectly, through resolution,
 * and it says nothing about how many images ride in one response — which is the gap this closes.
 * The two ceilings are independent: passing this budget does not make an individual export
 * acceptable to a provider, and vice versa.
 *
 * Figma's own MCP server sidesteps all of this by taking a single node per call and pointing
 * multi-node work at a separate download tool. Figwright accepts a batch — which is genuinely
 * useful for comparing screens in one round trip — and a batch is exactly what makes this budget
 * necessary rather than optional.
