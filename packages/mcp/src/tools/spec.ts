// deprecated). `.describe()` on a field becomes its JSON Schema description.
//
// Storing the built object rather than a raw shape is what lets every consumer share one instance:
// registration, the handlers that re-parse their own arguments, and the test-only derivation in
// `test/tool-schema.ts`. Rebuilding it per call — which the raw shape forced on eleven handlers —
// measured ~120x the cost of parsing against a prebuilt one.
