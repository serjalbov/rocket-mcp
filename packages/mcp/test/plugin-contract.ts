/**
 * Derive the argument surface every plugin-dispatched tool sends over the relay.
 *
 * This is the contract a sandbox handler has to keep up with, and the one place skew hides: the
 * server validates arguments with Zod and the handler re-reads them positionally (`const p = params
 * as { nodeId?: unknown; … }`), so an argument an older handler predates is not rejected — it is
 * dropped, and the write still answers `{ ok: true }`. Recording the surface is what turns "someone
 * added a field" from an invisible event into a diff.
 *
 * Paths are dotted and descend through arrays and unions (`track.keyframes[].easing.type`), because
 * a nested addition drops just as silently as a top-level one.
 *
 * A read/write tool dispatches its own schema verbatim, so the schema is the contract. A `local`
 * tool's handler builds the plugin payload by hand, so its schema is not: `serverOnlyArgs` names
 * the fields that stay on the server (an output path), and `null` there means the tool has no
 * sandbox handler of its own — its arguments belong to the tool it reuses, which records them.
 *
 * `batch.ops[].params` stops at `unknown` on purpose — it is the union of every other tool's
 * arguments, and each of those tools records its own entry here, so the arguments a batched op
 * carries are covered under the tool it batches rather than duplicated under `batch`.

 *   regex reports the old key and calls the file clean.
 * - Object literals handed straight to `dispatch(TOOL, { … })` — several tools build the payload for
 *   another tool by hand, so a field added there never passes through `...args` at all.
 * - `someArgs.field = …` on a `Record` built up before dispatch (`contextArgs`, `pluginArgs`).
