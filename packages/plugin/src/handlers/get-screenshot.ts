// pointed at any model — so it has to hold for all of them at once. Per vendor docs: Claude 4.7+

// at `original`, and GPT-5.6 defaults to keeping the input size; Gemini sets no long-edge limit and
// just tiles at 768px. 2576 is the tightest *hard* ceiling among them, which makes it the right
// number: it saturates the strictest client, and the others either accept it as sent or downscale it
// themselves — nobody is left sharper by us sending more. Going past it would only serve the lenient

// steps down rather than failing. The step-down applies to every node in the batch because one
