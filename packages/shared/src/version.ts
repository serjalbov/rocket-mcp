// Server ↔ plugin compatibility.
//
// The two halves of Figwright ship on one version (the `vX.Y.Z` tag; `packages/plugin/vite.config.ts`
// bakes `packages/mcp/package.json`'s version into the plugin bundle) but through different channels:
// the server updates itself via `npx @figwright/mcp@latest`, while the plugin is a zip the user
// imports by hand and then never thinks about again. Skew is therefore the *default* state, not an
// edge case.
//
// It bites in a way no gate here can see. Tool arguments are validated on the server (Zod, in
// `tools/`) and read positionally by the sandbox handler (`const p = params as { … }`), so a server
// that sends an argument an older handler never destructures gets no error — the field simply
// vanishes and the write reports `{ ok: true }`. Measured against the shipped releases: a v0.1.0
// plugin drops `layoutSizingHorizontal`, so "make this fill its container" reports success and
// changes nothing.
//
// **Skew warns; it never blocks.** Refusing the connection was built first and measured against a
// real old plugin, which is how the reason not to shipped itself: the plugin decides whether to keep
// retrying, and every plugin that would be refused is by definition too old to contain that
// decision. A v0.3.0 plugin re-offered the rejected handshake ~7 times a second, indefinitely — 195
// sockets in TIME_WAIT, steady state, from one Figma tab. Everything that could soften a refusal
// (stop retrying, show a banner) lives in the plugin, and so reaches only plugins that are already
// new enough not to need it. For the population this exists for, the server is the only half that
// can act at all.
//
// So the server acts by removing the *silence*, which was the actual defect — the call still runs,
// and every result carries {@linkcode pluginSkewNotice} telling the agent the result is unverified
// and the user should update. Failures carry it too: an old plugin answers METHOD_NOT_FOUND for
// every tool it predates, and unattributed that reads as "this tool is broken" rather than "your
// plugin is old" — the same misdirection as a silent wrong write, just noisier. A wrong write is
// still possible; it is no longer unattributable.
//
// This is also what MCP does at the equivalent seam, once you follow it past the version handshake:
// for optional behaviour a peer may not have, "the supporting party MUST either revert to core
// protocol behavior or reject the request" — reverting is a legitimate answer, not a lesser one. Its
// hard `UnsupportedProtocolVersionError` is reserved for a peer it genuinely cannot parse, which
// here is `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, still a refusal and still separate. (Worth noting the handshake itself
// is gone as of revision 2026-07-28: every request now carries its own version. That model relies on
// a client that can retry with a different one, which a Figma plugin cannot, so this stays a
// handshake in the shape of the earlier revisions.)
//
// Per-argument capability flags, LSP-style, are the other road not taken: they need a hand-kept
// table of which argument arrived when, and this repo knows where those end up — `PROTOCOL_VERSION`
// sat at its initial value for every release because nothing forced it to move.
// `test/plugin-contract.test.ts` is what forces this one to move.
